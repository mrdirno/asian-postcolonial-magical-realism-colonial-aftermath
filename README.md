## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a modern tech developer visits Whispering View and their app begins to display impossible data—conversations from 1927, maps of rooms that don't exist, or the biometric signature of the weeping botanist's wife.
- Create a 'Ghost Log' for the bungalow from Amrita's perspective, detailing the daily routines, triggers, and subtle changes in each spectral tenant, treating them as clients with unresolved cases.
- Imagine a chapter from the perspective of Mr. Varma, the Consortium man, who begins to experience faint, inexplicable sensations—the smell of tea and damp linen, a chill, a tune he can't place—after his visit, and how he rationalizes it.
- Write a 'found document'—a letter, a diary entry, or a colonial officer's report—that reveals the true, hidden tragedy of one of the ghosts, which Amrita discovers tucked in the floorboards or behind a brick.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Haunt Map' interactive visualization that layers the ghostly activity, architectural decay, and historical timelines of Whispering View, allowing users to explore the spatial and temporal density of its 'unfinished business'.
- Design a speculative 'Spectral Interface' system that Amrita might use to catalog and communicate with her ghostly tenants. What would its inputs and outputs be? How would it represent non-linear time and emotional residue as data?
